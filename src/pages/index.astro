       Iâ€™m Sai Rajesh Chittavarjula, a Computer Science graduate student at the University of South Dakota with over 2.5 years of experience as a Software Engineer. Iâ€™ve worked on building web applications, automating workflows using tools like Workato and Mulesoft, and developing internal tools that improved business efficiency. I enjoy solving coding problems, building projects with Python and web technologies, and learning new tech. Outside of coding, Iâ€™m into cinematography, reading blogs, and staying active in community and college events.
